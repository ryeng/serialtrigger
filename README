Serialtrigger listens to modem status line changes on a serial port and
executes commands when they change status.

Serialtrigger makes a blocking call to watch changes to the CTS, DCD,
DSR and RI status lines. When a line is brought high, a user defined
command is executed or the program exits. Different actions can be
defined for each line.
